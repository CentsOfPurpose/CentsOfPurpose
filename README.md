### Synopsis

Make a change with your change. Changing lives with your change, while changing your perspective.

### Motivation

### Usage

* Install node modules
```javascript
npm install
```
* Install nodemon
```javascript
npm install -g nodemon
```
* Start the server
```javascript
npm run dev
```

* Use npm start to run the server in a deployment environment
